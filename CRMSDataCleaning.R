#DatCleaning=========
setwd("~/Desktop/CRMS/CRMS")

#The excel file "CRMS_Marsh_Veg.csv" has been edited in excel to:
#remove spaces and signs not suitable for R like > /,
#fix the date format - some dates were in text format, some in a date format
#Bare Ground was renamed to "AaaProblem" and needs to go as it codes lack of species

#Cover (%) had non-numeric values: "<1" and "solitary" and empty records. I have transformed them as:
#"<1" = 0.5
#"solitary" = 0.25
#empty = 0.0 (In some case Cover Total was lower than single covers!!! Weird - I just left it as it is)

#I also created a new column called "SpecCode" that contains first 4 of Genus and first 4 of species names
#for ordination in vegan package. Vegan does not like long/uneven names.

#2. Further Datacleanig & Reduction========
#I decided to delete Aaaaprobl
#as they code for bare ground or nothing related to plants species,these were the plots that were hard to access and not surveyed:
  
#The species were coded with error so I fixed them as:
#Bolb(Asc to Bolbxxxx,   Dich(Hit to Dichxxxx,  Phan(Raf to Phanxxxx
#Scho(Rch to Schoxxxx,    CeraL to Ceraxxxx,     CeraBron to Ceraxxxx
#CentL to Centxxxx, CephL to Cephxxxx,    ZizaDÃ¶ll to Zizaxxxx
#IvaL to Ivaxxxxx and so on to make all names 8 long in characters (to make work smoothly in Vegan).

# I also removed the field name column and the comments. 
#Colums with species common names and additional explanation & comment columns removed. Currently 24 columns
#File size went down to ~30MB.

#3. Further Data Cleaning============
#Load DATA:

#We agreed to remove Swamp records (Community = "Swamp") as they had no records of our target species= Phraaust
#We also agreed on removing all records from outside the plot where In.Out = "Out"

dim(veg2)#236382     24

#Save it and commit to Github today [21June2017]

#4. Further cleaning:
#Data contains 21 duplicates for example:
CRMS0258_V70<- v.wide[v.wide$StationID=="CRMS0258_V70", ]
CRMS0258_V70[,1:5]
#Duplicated records as CRMS team measured the same plot twice withing one year sometimes.
# + 566 plots that were not consistently measured.

#Creating (08jul2017) new veg data with 2007 plots consistently surveyed across all years===========

#SOIL DATA=========
#021jun2017 we downloaded a more robust data off CRMS website.
#During clearning  11991 rows were removed as salinity was not measured there
